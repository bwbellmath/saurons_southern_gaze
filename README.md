# saurons_southern_gaze
`saurons_southern_gaze.py [progress rows]` : generates
                `saurons_southern_gaze.svg` which should be opened
                with Inkscape. `[progress rows]` should be an integer
                indicating rows that have been completed -- these will
                be colored red in Inkscape.
